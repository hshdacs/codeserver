# About Code-Server

- First start with  the [user manual](https://code-server.dev/docs/usage/basics) to get an overview of how code-server
- Code-server is VS Code running on a remote server, accessible through the browser. Code on your chromebook or any other browser with a consistent dev environment.
- Main purpose of this code server  is to provide a simple and convenient way for users to easily develop for linux, in your windows or Mac workstation.
- There is an advantage of large cloud servers to speed up tests, preserve battery life when you're on the go. All intensive computation runs on your server.

# Getting Started

- First Clone this below repository in your system
https://github.com/hshdacs/codeserver.git

- Navigate to the repository
cd codeserver

- You can see multiple folder with different versions  of code-server, choose the latest version.
- You should be installed with docker to run this code-server  image. If you  don't have docker installed please install it from here.  [docker] https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

# Dockerized Code-Server
This repository contains a Dockerfile and setup script to create a Docker image for running code-server, a web-based version of Visual Studio Code.

## Installation Steps for Dockerized Code Server:

1. Make sure you have docker installed on your machine by running `docker -v` in the terminal. If not, please install it.
2. Select a version from above, you can see the dck.sh file on the codeserver folder.
3. run this command in your terminal './dck.sh /PathToThe/Version/folder'. For example if you have chosen 4.22.1
   command should be './dck.sh /PathToThe/Version/4.22.1'.
- It builds a docker image  using that specific version.

    # what dck.sh file does?
    - this shell script designed to automate some common docker tasks, such as building docker images and running docker containers.
    - It initializes some variables such as 'COMMAND', 'VERSION', 'IMAGE', 'TAG', 'DETACH', AND 'NAME'.
    - Then it checks if the user is root or not and asks for sudo password if needed.
    - After that it pulls the IMAGE with TAG from Docker Hub.
    - If DETACH is true then it runs the container in background else it will run in foreground.
    - Finally, it prints out the IP address which you can use to access the server.
    - Before building the docker image, it extracts the image name and version from the Dockerfile directory path.
    - the image name is taken from the directory, and the version is taken from the last directory in the path.

4. Run this [command] ' docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 3000:3000 codeserver:4.21.0' - It helps to run the container of already built docker image.
    - here we have opened two ports when  running the container one is 8080 (HTTP) & another is 3000(Websocket).
     
     # what docker file does, when we run this commad
     - Dockerfile utilizes a multi-stage build process, install necessary packages such as 'alpine-sdk', 'libc6-compat', 'nodejs', 'npm', 'python3', - we can also define in this docker file whichever the packages we need it will install automatically.
     - alpine:3.18 as main - setup the main environment for running the code-server instance.
     - installs nodejs (using nvm) & yarn.
     - sets up .bashrc so that bash commands work inside the container.
     - ubuntu:focal as build - used to build the final image.
     - copies all the files from main into build.
     - installs VSCode & extensions required by me.
     - changes the owner of home directory to vscode.
     - makes entrypoint to codeserver-setup.sh executable.

     Overall, this Dockerfile automates tge process of setting up a code-server instance within a docker container, providing users with a lighweight abd portable development environment based on visual studio code. It is written to streamline the deployment and usage of code-server for development purposes.

5. now click on the 8080 port in the docker desktop container. It will redirect to this  link http://localhost:8080/. you can see the visual studio code running on a server.

    # what does codeserver-setup.sh does?

    1. Variable Initialization:
        - It initializes some variables like UID, APKINST, and CSINST.
        - If the script is not running as root (UID != 0), it uses sudo for package installation (APKINST).
    2. First Time Setup:
        * Checks if a VSIX file (chrisdias.vscode-opennewinstance-0.0.12.vsix) exists in /tmp.
        * If found, it installs several VS Code extensions using code-server --install-extension.
        * Removes the VSIX file after installation.
    3. Argument Parsing:
        * Parses the arguments passed to the script.
        * If an argument contains an equal sign (=), it evaluates the expression. Otherwise, it sets the argument to true.
    4. Dependency Installation:
        * Installs various dependencies based on the provided arguments or defaults.
        * Dependencies include Subversion, Python 3 (with Jupyter if specified), Java (default version 17), C/C++ development tools, TCC (Tiny C Compiler), Rust, and PowerShell.
    5. User Setup (if running as root):
        * If running as root, it prepares the user's home directory ($HOME) and sets up some basic configurations.
        * Creates a .bashrc file with an alias for ls -lF.
        * Creates a workspace directory if it doesn't exist.
        * Changes ownership of the home directory to the user coder.
        * Changes the password of the user coder if SUDO_PASSWORD is provided.
    6. Start Code-Server (if running as root):
        * If running as root, it starts code-server as the user coder on port 8080, binding to all available interfaces.
        The script starts code-server with the provided arguments. User can also edit this file with their specified extensions and install.

6. Git setup in your code-server
    - open terminal in your code-server vs code
    - run this command "git config --global user.name 'Your github profile name' ", Next
    - run this command "git config --global user.email 'your github emailid' ", Next
    - you can clone your existing project or create new project.
